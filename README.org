* Topic Prediction for the Avaaj Otalo Platform using Decision Tree Classifier

- Team Members: Seema Puthyapurayil & Priya Iyer

Installation Pre-requisites 
+ Python 2.x
+ scikit-learn


Steps to run the classifier on your machine
+ 1. Download the zip folder of the master branch
+ 2. Unzip the zip folder
+ 3. In your command line, Go to AOMining-Master/classify folder
+ 4. Run topicPrediction.py and simply follow the instructions

Also, checkout the data/OutputClassifier file to look at some sample output

Note: A lot of code as been commented in topicPrediction.py because it was during the training phase of the classifier. The classifier is now loaded from a pickled object called "topic_classifier.pkl" which contains the classifier model. Every time a new test data arrives, instead of training the classifier again, the pickled classifier object is used. This saves a lot of processing time.
